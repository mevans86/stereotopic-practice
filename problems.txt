(<i>S</i>)-Ibuprofen	diastereotopic	<b style="color: red">Nope!</b> This molecule lacks symmetry&mdash;what does this tell you about the possible relationships between the highlighted methyl groups? Do both methyl groups have the same connectivity? Determine the answers to these questions, and you\'ll be in business.	<b style="color: green">Nice!</b> The methyl groups have the same connectivity, but are not related by symmetry. Thus, they exhibit a diastereotopic relationship.
<i>cis</i>-1,6-Dibromodecalin	homotopic	<b style="color: red">Nope!</b> Look for an axis of rotational symmetry in this compound, or consider applying the Q-test. Can the bromine atoms be exchanged by a rotation that leaves the rest of the molecule looking the same as before the rotation?	<b style="color: green;">Nice!</b> This compound possesses a rotational axis of symmetry pointing directly out of the screen toward you. The bromine atoms are exchanged by a 180&deg; rotation about this axis. The Q-test yields two identical Q-molecules when the bromine atoms are replaced with Q\'s, indicating that the bromines have a homotopic relationship.
Efavirenz	diastereotopic	<b style="color: red">Nope!</b> Try applying the Q-test. Note that when one of the CH<sub>2</sub> groups is replaced with Q, a new stereocenter forms (where?). How is the configuration of this new stereocenter related to the CH<sub>2</sub> group replaced with Q? How are the resulting Q-molecules related as isomers?	<strong style="color: green;">Nice!</strong> The CH<sub>2</sub> groups share a diastereotopic relationship. The Q-test yields diastereomers, since there are other stereocenters in the molecule whose configurations are unaffected by the replacement of the highlighted CH<sub>2</sub> groups with Q.
Cyclopentadiene	homotopic	<b style="color: red">Nope!</b> Look for elements of symmetry in this compound, or apply the Q-test. What isomeric relationship do the Q-molecules share?	<strong style="color: green;">Nice!</strong> Cyclopentadiene possesses an axis of rotational symmetry that exchanges the two highlighted hydrogen atoms. Hence, those hydrogens share a homotopic relationship. Cyclopentadiene shows only three <sup>1</sup>H NMR signals: two for the homotopic pairs of alkenyl protons, and one for the homotopic CH<sub>2</sub> protons.
Propadiene (allene)	homotopic	<b style="color: red">Nope!</b> Seeing the symmetry elements of allene is tricky. Search very hard for a rotational axis of symmetry in this compound. Or, apply the Q-test and try to superimpose the Q-molecules by rotating them.	<strong style="color: green;">Nice!</strong> The axis of rotational symmetry in allene is <em>very</em> tough to see. Well done! This axis exchanges the highlighted hydrogens, indicating that they share a homotopic relationship. Believe it or not, the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of allene contains only a single peak!
Citric acid	constitutionally-heterotopic	<b style="color: red">Nope!</b> When identifying stereotopic relationships, the first thing you should ask yourself is: do the groups of interest have the same connectivity?	<strong style="color: green;">Nice!</strong> The two highlighted hydroxyl groups have different connectivity. Hence, they share a constitutionally heterotopic relationship: they\'re very different from one another.
<i>meso</i>-Tartaric acid	enantiotopic	<b style="color: red">Nope!</b> Consider a different conformer of this molecule, which better illustrates its important symmetry elements. Can you identify a conformer that has a plane of symmetry? Alternatively, compare the appropriate Q-molecules by trying to superimpose them. 	<strong style="color: green;">Nice!</strong> <em>meso</em>-Tartaric acid is an achiral compound. One of its conformers has a plane of symmetry that exchanges the two hydroxyl groups. This compound lacks rotational symmetry that exchanges the hydroxyls; hence, the hydroxyl groups share an enantiotopic relationship.
Phosphoric acid	homotopic	<b style="color: red">Nope!</b> Consider a highly symmetric conformer of phosphoric acid&mdash;the three-dimensional image may be somewhat misleading. Can you find an axis of rotational symmetry in the Lewis structure at right?	<strong style="color: green;">Nice!</strong> Phosphoric acid contains an axis of rotational symmetry that passes right through its P=O bond. A 120&deg; rotation about this axis exchanges the hydroxyl groups while leaving the rest of the molecule unchanged in appearance.
