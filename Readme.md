# Stereotopic Relationships Problems
This simple collection of problems tests the user's ability to identify stereotopic relationships between atoms or functional groups. To add a problem to this collection, follow these steps.

1. Draw the molecule in ChemDraw.
2. Build the molecule in [NetMol](http://www.metallacycle.com/play/netmol/jmol?use=java), select the atoms/groups of interest, and save the result as a .jmol file. To determine how to name the image and Jmol files, check [problems.txt](http://www.metallacycle.com/play/coursera/stereo/problems.txt). Name the files using the next available line number.
3. Upload the files to the [../assets/images/stereo](http://www.metallacycle.com/play/coursera/assets/images/stereo/) folder.
4. Add a line to [problems.txt](http://www.metallacycle.com/play/coursera/stereo/problems.txt) with the name, correct relationship, incorrect feedback, and correct feedback.
